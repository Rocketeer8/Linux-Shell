What did I work on in the last three days?
    - implemented the Path traversal to change directories
    - updated CRC cards 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish the MakeDirectory command by updating the execute method
    - finish the CRC cards to reflect our final design

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need to finalize our design for calling commands
