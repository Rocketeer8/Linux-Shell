What did I work on in the last three days?
    - discuss with team changes needed for the execute method inside commands
    - fixed bugs with the Path traversal

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - check for bugs in the program
    - add comments and javadoc
    - finish the CRC cards to reflect our final design

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need to finish echo command to test the whole shell (minor issue)
