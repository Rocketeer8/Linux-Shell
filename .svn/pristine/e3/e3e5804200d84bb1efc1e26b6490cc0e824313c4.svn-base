What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed the design ideas for file class and echo commands

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish File class
    - start working on Echo command class

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not sure how content of a file should be store.
    - Not sure if inheritance should be in Echo command
