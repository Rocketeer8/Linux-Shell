What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Implementing the File, Dir and Path classes
    - Discussed the implementation design for parsing, error handling with teammates.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Refine and finish PathTraversal and Directory class.
    - Disuss more about implementation design.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not sure if some classes should be instance or static class.
    - Not sure if inheritance should be in Echo command
    - Not sure how to effectively handle all the input errors from user.
