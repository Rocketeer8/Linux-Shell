What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for receiving and parsing input commands
    - implemented the Directory class and created methods for Directory objects
    - implemented the MakeDirectory class to create directorys in the JShell
    - tested implementation of Directory and MakeDirectory in JShell

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - update MakeDirectory class to work only with two arguments
    - collaborate with team to update Directory class and File class so they work together
    - update CRC Cards

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need Path class to finish implementing Directory class and MakeDirectory class
    - need Error class and Output class to output errors
    - need Command class to parse and run MakeDirectory command on JShell
