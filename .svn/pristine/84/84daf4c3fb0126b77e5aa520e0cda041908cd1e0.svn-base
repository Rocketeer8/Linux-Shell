What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Worked on RetrieveUrl Class and its methods
    - Finished Search Class and its methods
    - Worked on Test cases for History

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish RetrieveUrl and its methods
    - Work on test cases for some of the classes in command
		
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Do I treat a URL with a trailing "/" the same as one without?
    - What should execute() return so that it can be tested?
