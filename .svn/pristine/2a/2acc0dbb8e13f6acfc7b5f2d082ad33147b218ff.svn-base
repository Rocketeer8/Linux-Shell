What did I work on in the last three days?
    - discussed with team on implementation using Singleton Design Pattern
    - changed Directory objects to store content using Hashmaps instead of ArrayList after consulting with the team
    - began designing and implementing the Path class
    - updated MakeDirectory command to only allow for two inputs

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - continue to implement the Path class
    - continue to update CRC Cards to match our design

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need to create a design for Path class to traverse through parent directories
