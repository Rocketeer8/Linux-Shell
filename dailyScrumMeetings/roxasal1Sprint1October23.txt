What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Completed Exit and exit command
    - Worked on EchoAppend and echo command for appending
    - Brainstormed with team on implementation of the echo command 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Continue working on EchoAppend
		- Work on echo command for appending and creating a new file
		
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need File to complete EchoAppend
	  - Should EchoAppend need inheritance with EchoOverwrite or vice versa
