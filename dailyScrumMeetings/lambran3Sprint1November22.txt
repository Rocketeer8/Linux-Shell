What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finish implementing RemoveDirectory
    - began implementing MoveDirectory and CopyDirectory
    - add comments new classes

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish implementing and test MoveDirectory and CopyDirectory
    - add javadoc to the new classes
    - update crcCards
    - implement test cases

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not blocked on anything. However, I am unsure about whether or not recursion is required in RemoveDirectory.
