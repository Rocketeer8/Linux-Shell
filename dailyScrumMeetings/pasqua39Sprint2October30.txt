What did I work on in the last three days?
	-Implemented a large portion of the InputParser class
	-Implemented the Shell class to hold various information required for the commands 	 to execute
	-Update the StandardError class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	-Try to make accessing the shell more efficient (maybe try using singleton)

Am I blocked on anything?
   	-Need a path handling class so I can perform the correct checks and parsing for a 	 given file or directory
