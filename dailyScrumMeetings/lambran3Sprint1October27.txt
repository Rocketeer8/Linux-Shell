What did I work on in the last three days?
    - discussed changes to CRC Cards for new design with team
    - worked with teammate to update Directory class to inherit from File class
    - discussed how commands will be parsed and how to check valid command calls

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - update MakeDirectory class to work only with two arguments
    - brainstorm how to implement Path class and discuss it with team
    - continue to update CRC Cards to match our design

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need to implementing the parsing and calling of each individual command
    - need somewhere to store current working directory and the root directory
