What did I work on in the last three days?
	-Completed a large portion of the crccards to incorporate our new design
	-Implemented some error checks in the ErrorHandling class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	-Make progress on the command parsing and error handling mechanism
		-Complete the StandardError class to check every type of input for errors
		-Implement a parsing class to convert an input into the appropriate type 		 for execution

Am I blocked on anything?
