What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Implemented the File class, and set it as parent of Dir.
    - Started to Implement Echo and EchoOverwrite.
    - Discussed the implementation design for parsing and executing command with teammates

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Refine and finish File and Echo class
    - Talk more about implementation design.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Still havn't finalize implementation design, which affect the actual implementation of my classes.
    - Not sure if inheritance should be in Echo command
