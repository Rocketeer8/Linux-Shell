What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Implemented ListFile, and PathTraversal
    - Started to Implement Echo and EchoOverwrite.
    - Discussed the implementation design for parsing and implementation of command classes with teammates

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Refine and finish PathTRaversal, ListFile.
    - Implement Echo and ChangeDirectory class
    - Talk more about implementation design.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not sure if path class should use singleton or just static
