What did I work on in the last three days?
    - began implementing test cases for RemoveDirectory
    - tested and updated Move and Copy commands

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish implementing test cases for MoveDirectory and CopyDirectory
    - add javadoc to the new classes
    - update crcCards

Am I blocked on anything?
    - unsure about whether or not recursion is required in RemoveDirectory. Will  need to clarify in Office Hours
