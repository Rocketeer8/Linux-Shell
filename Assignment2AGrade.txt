==== A2 phase I marking ====

Group number: 0434
UTORID usernames of members: lambran3,liuhai6,pasqua39,roxasal1
Total deductions: 1
Grade: A (89%)

Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    https://transcripts.utoronto.ca/faqs/grade-scale/
When converting from letter grade to numerical grade, we will use the higher end of the letter grade to convert your mark.
--For example, the higher end of A+ is 100.
--For example, the higher end of A is 89.
.
.
.
In the event that you get a F, your conversion from letter grade to numerical grade will be based on the discretion of the instructor. 

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog. 

==== Product and Sprint backlogs ==== [up to -6]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  No evidence of Product or Sprint backlog -6
- [ ]  No evidence of team assigning tasks to team members -3
- [ ]  SB items not taken directly from PB -1
- [ ]  SB items not broken down into smaller steps -1
- [ ]  PB, SB uses noticeably bad grammar and/or spelling -2

TA COMMENTS: 

==== Java Style ==== [up to -6]

Steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  Java naming conventions not followed (camelCase, no_underscores) -1
- [ ]  Instance variable names not meaningful (e.g., "Label1" is not a good name) -1
- [ ]  Bad indentation -1
- [ ]  Lack of consistency in style across files -1
- [ ]  Bad use of whitespace: too much or too little -1
- [ ]  Class names are frequently not noun phrases -1
- [ ]  Method names are frequently not verb phrases -1
- [ ]  Not following the 80character column width limit. -1

TA COMMENTS: 

==== Design ==== [up to -6]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  public instance variables instead of setters and getters -1 to -2
- [x]  not a good breakdown of classes and methods (everything static;) -1
- [ ]  long methods exist (more than roughly 30 lines from brace to brace) -1
- [ ]  hard to add new commands -1
- [ ]  no unified path handling mechanism -2
- [ ]  redirection doesn't easily incorporate new commands -2

TA COMMENTS:
 - The documentation for each command can be a final private static string even to be honest
 - Not a huge fan of the super execute... This check might be more appropriate as some decorator if you ask me
    - Or even a utility, since by having this implemented partially implies that you can run it as is
 - Filesystem stores commands???? That is horrible breakdown (or at the very least naming) (-1)
 - Filesystem is nice, perhaps having some way to traverse back up the tree can be extremely helpful for you ;)
    - ~parent instance in FileObj *cough* *cough*

==== Javadoc ==== [up to -3]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  Missing Javadoc on methods -1 for infrequent problems, up to -3 for frequent
- [ ]  Missing Javadoc on class -1
- [ ]  No Javadoc on instance vars -1
- [ ]  Missing use @param and @return tags -1
- [ ]  Unclear English: bad grammar, bad spelling up to -2

TA COMMENTS: 

==== Testing ==== [up to -6] 
Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  No test cases exist for public methods -6
- [ ]  Some testing done for all classes and methods, but not thoroughly up to -3
- [ ]  Test quality is inadequate or tests uninformative -1 to -2
        e.g., testing using lots of print statements instead of assert calls
- [ ]  Code not written to be testable -2

TA COMMENTS: 

==== Correctness ==== [up to -6]

- [ ]  Code doesn't compile without modification (if the fix is simple) -1
- [ ]  Code that is complete (from the SB) doesn't work completely: up to -2
- [ ]  Code crashes: -3
- [ ]  Each missing/incomplete feature -1

TA COMMENTS:
 - Very simple and "empty" compared to most, but nothing wrong with that... less is more!
 - Perfect score! woot! (Here is your reward https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6pCytV_7iY)
